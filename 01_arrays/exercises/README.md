Exercise 1 - User's Name to Event Types
Write a method that takes the user's name and an array containing the names of their different published event types 
and return an array of new event type names where each name has the user's name (with possesives added!) appended to them. 
Make sure your method runs successfully if no arguments are input!

    Example:
    ets_with_name("Nik", ["One on One"]) --> ["Nik's One on One"]
